# Remembering how to C

In 326, C sells C shells down by the C shore. Can't you C it?

In all seriousness, C is the language of choice for OS development (for better or worse). You will get comfortable using C in this class. Complete the exercises in this repo to help get the C flowing again.

## Instructions

The programs here all have something wrong with them. Your job is to:

1. Determine what the problem is
2. Fix the problem
3. Explain what was wrong (**why** the bug occurred) and how you fixed it. Edit the comment headers at the top of each file to give your explanation.

To compile all the programs, run `make`. We'll be using `make` quite a bit this semester.
